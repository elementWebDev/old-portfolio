/********************************************
 Comment your JavaScript Code
********************************************/
/*
 Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */

/* This is a 
   multi-line comment */
/*Best Practice
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

Instructions
Try creating one of each type of comment
*/

// single line comment
/*
multi-line comment
*/


/********************************************
 Declare JavaScript Variables
********************************************/
/*
 In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, Boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

Instructions
Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.

Hint
Look at the ourName example if you get stuck.
*/
// Example
var ourName;

// Define myName below this line
var myName;

/********************************************
 Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
********************************************/
/*
 In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

myVariable = 5;

Assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
Assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.

Instructions
Assign the value 7 to variable a.

Assign the contents of a to variable b
*/
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;


/********************************************
 Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
********************************************/
/*
 It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

Instructions
Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9
*/
// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 9;


/********************************************
 Understanding Uninitialized Variables
********************************************/
/*
 When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

Instructions
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined
*/
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";


/********************************************
 Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
********************************************/
/*
 In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice
Write variable names in Javascript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Examples:

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;
Instructions
Fix the variable declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase

// Declarations

var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;
*/

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;

var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;


/********************************************
 Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

var sum = 10 + 0;
var sum = 10 + 10;


/********************************************
 Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

/*
 The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4

Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

Instructions
Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator

/********************************************
 Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

myVar += 5; will add 5 to myVar.

 Declare String Variables
********************************************/
/*
 Previously we have used the code

var myName = "your name";

/********************************************
 Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
********************************************/

/*
 When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";

This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

Instruction
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes"
*/

/*
var myStr; // Change this line
*/
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\""; // Change this line


/********************************************
 Quoting Strings with Single Quotes 
********************************************/

/*
 String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, so long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some languages, single and double quotes are functionally identical in JavaScript.

"This string has \"double quotes\" in it"

The value in using one or the other has to do with the need to escape quotes of the same type. Unless they are escaped, you cannot have more than one pair of whichever quote type begins a string.

If you have a string with many double quotes, this can be difficult to read and write. Instead, use single quotes:

'This string has "double quotes" in it. And "probably" lots of them.'

Instructions
Change the provided string from double to single quotes and remove the escaping.
*/
//var myStr = "<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>";

/*
 Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Here is a table of common escape sequences:

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	new line
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

Instructions
Encode the following sequence, separated by spaces:
backslash tab tab carriage-return new-line and assign it to myStr

//var myStr; // Change this line
var myStr = "\\ \t \t \r \n"; // Change this line



/********************************************
 Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator 
********************************************/

/*
 In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Instructions
Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.
*/
/*
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
*/
// Only change code below this line
//var myStr;

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";


/********************************************
 Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
********************************************/

/*
 We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Instructions
Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
"This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator.
*//*
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
*/
// Only change code below this line
//var myStr;

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";


/********************************************
 Constructing Strings with Variables
********************************************/

/*
 Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Instructions
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am swell!"
*//*
// Example
var ourName = "Free Code Camp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
*/
// Only change code below this line
//var myName;
//var myStr;

var myName = "Ivan";

/********************************************
 Appending Variables to Strings
********************************************/

/*
 Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Instructions
Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.
*//*
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "Free Code Camp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective;
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";

/********************************************
 Find the Length of a String 
********************************************/

/*
 You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

"Alan Peter".length; // 10

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

Instructions
Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.
*/
// Example
/*
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;

/*
 Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Instructions
Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

Hint
Try looking at the firstLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.

/********************************************
 Understand String Immutability
********************************************/
/*
 In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

var myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";
Instructions
Correct the assignment to myStr to achieve the desired effect
*//*
// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr[0] = "H"; // Fix Me
*/
myStr = "Hello World";


/********************************************
 Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
********************************************/

/*
 You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Instructions
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

Hint
Try looking at the secondLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.
*/
/*
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";

/********************************************
 Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
********************************************/

/*
 In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Instructions
Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

Hint
Try looking at the lastLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.

/********************************************
 Use Bracket Notation to Find the NthtoLast Character in a String
********************************************/

/*
 You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Instructions

 Access MultiDimensional Arrays With Indexes
********************************************/

/*
 One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of bracket refers to the entries in the outer-most array, and each subsequent level of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

var arr = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9],
    [[10,11,12], 13, 14]

/********************************************
 Manipulate Arrays With .push()                 // add to the end
********************************************/

/*
 An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameter and "pushes" it onto the end of the array.

var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);
// arr is now [1,2,3,4]
Instructions
Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.
*/

// Example
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.push(["happy", "joy"]); 
// ourArray now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]

// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

// Only change code below this line.
myArray.push(["dog", 3]);


/********************************************
 Manipulate Arrays With .pop
 (take off from the end)
********************************************/

/*
 Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable.

Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

For example, for the code
var oneDown = [1, 4, 6].pop();
the variable oneDown now holds the value 6 and the array becomes [1, 4].

Instructions
Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray, assigning the "popped off" value to removedFromMyArray
*/
// Example
var ourArray = [1,2,3];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.pop(); 
// removedFromOurArray now equals 3, and ourArray now equals [1,2]

*****************************/
//(shift and push are array methods. so do arr.push(item))
/*
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

Instructions
Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray, assigning the "shifted off" value to removedFromMyArray.

myArray should now equal [["dog", 3]].
removedFromMyArray should contain ["John", 23]

/*
Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

Instructions
Add ["Paul",35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift()
*/
// Example
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this:

functionName();

Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Instructions
Create a function called reusableFunction which prints "Hi World" to the dev console.
Call the function.

}

reusableFunction();

// Only change code below this line

/********************************************
 Passing Values to Functions with Arguments 
********************************************/
/*
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun:

testFun("Hello", "World");

We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World". Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World". Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

Instructions
Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
Call the function
*/
// Example
function functionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a - b);
}
functionWithArgs(10, 5); // Outputs 5

/********************************************
 Global Scope and Functions
********************************************/
/*
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.

Instructions
Declare a global variable myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it to have a value of 10

Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var keyword
*/
// Declare your variable here
var myGlobal = 10; // kind of misleading, still declare with var!

function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
  oopsGlobal = 5;
}

// Only change code above this line
function fun2() {
  var output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {

/********************************************
 Local Scope and Functions
********************************************/

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  var loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}
myTest(); // "foo"
console.log(loc); // "undefined"
loc is not defined outside of the function.

Instructions
Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope. Run the tests and then follow the instructions commented out in the editor.

/********************************************
 Global vs Local Scope in Functions
********************************************/
/*
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

var someVar = "Hat";
function myFun() {
  var someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

/********************************************
 Return a Value from a Function with Return

We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

ourSum = sum(5, 12);

will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.

 Understanding Boolean Values
********************************************/
/*
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

/***********************************************
 Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
***********************************************/
/*
If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions because they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
     return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}
test(true);  // returns "It was true"
test(false); // returns "It was false"
When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns "It was true". When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns "It was false".

Instructions
Create an if statement inside the function to return "Yes, that was true" if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return "No, that was false" otherwise
*/
// Example
function ourFunction(isItTrue) {
  if (isItTrue) { 
    return "Yes, it's true";
  }
  return "No, it's false";
}

// Setup
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {

  // Only change code below this line.
  if (wasThatTrue) {

  // Only change code above this line.

}

// Change this value to test
trueOrFalse(false);


/******************************************
 Comparison with the Equality Operator
******************************************/
/*
There are many Comparison Operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
     return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return "Equal". Otherwise, the function will return "Not Equal".

In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

   1   ==  1    // true
   1   ==  2    // false
   1   == '1'   // true
  "3"  ==  3    // true
Instructions
Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when val is equivalent to 12

/*************************************************
 Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator

/*
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). Unlike the equality operator, strict equality tests both the data type and value of the compared elements.

Examples

3 === 3   // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

Instructions
Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return "Equal" when val is strictly equal to 7

/****************************************************
 Selecting from many options with Switch Statements
****************************************************/
/*
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which defines various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is a pseudocode example:

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Instructions
Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - "alpha"
2 - "beta"
3 - "gamma"
4 - "delta"

Here are some helpful links:

/***********************************************
 Adding a default option in Switch statements
***********************************************/
/*
 In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

 Returning Boolean Values from Functions

    if (a === b) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
  Since === returns true or false, we can simply return the result of the comparison:

  function isEqual(a,b) {
    return a === b;

  Instructions
  Fix the function isLess to remove the if/else statements.

/***********************************
 Counting Cards
***********************************/
/*
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K','A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string "Bet" if the count is positive, or "Hold" if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision ("Bet" or "Hold") should be separated by a single space.

Example Output
"-3 Hold"
"5 Bet"

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.

/*====================================================================================
  OBJECTS
====================================================================================*/



/*************************
 Build JavaScript Objects
**************************/
/*
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Here's a sample object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Instructions
Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.
*/

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Fender",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["family", "friendly people"]
};


/***************************************************
 Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator
****************************************************/

/*
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

//- The dot operator is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using the dot operator (.) to read an object property:

var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
Instructions
Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object property shirt.
*/

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // ballcap
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // jersey


/***************************************************
 Accessing Objects Properties with Bracket Notation
***************************************************/

/*
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in it, you will need to use bracket notation.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object property:

var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Instructions
Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation.
*/

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj['an entree'];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj['the drink'];    // Change this line


/********************************************
 Accessing Objects Properties with Variables
********************************************/
/*
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to use a variable to access a property. This can be very useful for iterating through lists of the object properties or for doing the lookup.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

var someProp = "propName";
var myObj = {
  propName: "Some Value"
}
myObj[someProp]; // "Some Value"
Here is one more:

var myDog = "Hunter";
var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
}
var breed = dogs[myDog]; // "Hunter"
console.log(breed) // "Doberman"
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name

Instructions
Use the playerNumber variable to lookup player 16 in testObj using bracket notation.
*/
=
// Setup
var testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line;

var playerNumber = 16;       // Change this Line
var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this Line


/********************************************
 Updating Object Properties
********************************************/

/*
 After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

For example, let's look at ourDog:

var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper". Here's how we update his object's name property:

ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or

ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".

Instructions
Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from "Coder" to "Happy Coder". You can use either dot or bracket notation.
*/

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.name = "Happy Camper";

// Setup
var myDog = {
  "name": "Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Free Code Camp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line.
myDog.name = "Happy Coder";


/********************************************
 Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
********************************************/

/*
 You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".

Instructions
Add a "bark" property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.
*/

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Free Code Camp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line.
myDog.bark = "yap-yip";


/********************************************
 Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
********************************************/

/*
 We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;

Instructions
Delete the "tails" property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.
*/

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;

  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Free Code Camp Campers"],
  "bark": "woof"
};

// Only change code below this line.
delete myDog.tails;


/********************************************
 Using Objects for Lookups
********************************************/

/*
 Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2]; // "Y"
alpha[24]; // "C"

var value = 2;
alpha[value]; // "Y"
Instructions
Convert the switch statement into a lookup table called lookup. Use it to lookup val and assign the associated string to the result variable.
*/

// Setup
function phoneticLookup(val) {
  var result = "";

  // Only change code below this line
 var lookup = {
    "alpha":"Adams",
    "bravo":"Boston",
    "charlie":"Chicago",
    "delta":"Denver",
    "echo":"Easy",
    "foxtrot":"Frank"
    };
  
  result = lookup[val];

  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}

// Change this value to test
phoneticLookup("charlie");



/********************************************
 Testing Objects for Properties
********************************************/
/*
 Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.

Example

var myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};
myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");    // true
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false
Instructions
Modify the function checkObj to test myObj for checkProp. If the property is found, return that property's value. If not, return "Not Found".
*/

// Setup
var myObj = {
  gift: "pony",
  pet: "kitten",
  bed: "sleigh"
};

function checkObj(checkProp) {
if (myObj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp)) {
return myObj[checkProp];
} else {
return "Not Found";
  }
}

// Test your code by modifying these values
checkObj("pet");



/********************************************
 Introducing JavaScript Object Notation JSON

 As we have seen in earlier examples, JSON objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, Array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

var ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];
ourPets[0].names[1]; // "Fluffy"
ourPets[1].names[0]; // "Spot"
Instructions
Retrieve the second tree from the variable myPlants using object dot and array bracket notation.

/********************************************
 Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
********************************************/ 
/*
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a "for loop" because it runs "for" a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evalutes to true. When condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final-expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final-expression.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0,1,2,3,4].

Instructions
Use a for loop to work to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.
*/
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++ ) {
  myArray.push(i);
}


/********************************************
 Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
********************************************/ 
/*
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8].

Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.

Instructions
Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.
*/
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for (var i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}


/********************************************
 Count Backwards With a For Loop
********************************************/ 
/*
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.

In order to count backwards by twos, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final-expression.

We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i=10; i > 0; i-=2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [10,8,6,4,2].

Let's change our initialization and final-expression so we can count backward by twos by odd numbers.

Instructions
Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.
*/
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for (var i = 9; i > 0; i -= 2 ) {
  myArray.push(i);
}


/********************************************
 Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
********************************************/ 
/*
A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:

var arr = [10,9,8,7,6];
for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
Remember that Arrays have zero-based numbering, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops when i is at length - 1.

Instructions
Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total.
*/
// Example
var ourArr = [ 9, 10, 11, 12];
var ourTotal = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < ourArr.length; i++) {
  ourTotal += ourArr[i];
}

// Setup
var myArr = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Only change code below this line
var total = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++ ) {
  total += myArr[i];
}


/********************************************
 Nesting For Loops
********************************************/ 
/*
If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:

var arr = [
  [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
];
for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    console.log(arr[i][j]);
  }
}
This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.

Instructions
Modify function multiplyAll so that it multiplies the product variable by each number in the sub-arrays of arr
*/
function multiplyAll(arr) {
  var product = 1;
  // Only change code below this line
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
      product *= arr[i][j];
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return product;
}

// Modify values below to test your code
multiplyAll([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6,7]]);


/********************************************
 Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
********************************************/ 
/*
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

Another type of JavaScript loop is called a "while loop", because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

 Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
********************************************/ 
/*
Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1

Note
Like Storing Values with the Equal Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can simply return the value of the Math.random() function.

/********************************************
 Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript
********************************************/ 
/*
It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
Multiply that random decimal by 20.
Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);

We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

/********************************************
 Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range

/*
Instead of generating a random number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

Instructions
Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive

 Sift through Text with Regular Expressions
********************************************/ 
/*
Regular expressions are used to find certain words or patterns inside of strings.

For example, if we wanted to find the word the in the string The dog chased the cat, we could use the following regular expression: /the/gi

Let's break this down a bit:

/ is the start of the regular expression.

the is the pattern we want to match.

/ is the end of the regular expression.

g means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one.

i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.

Instructions
Select all the occurrences of the word and in testString.

You can do this by replacing the . part of the regular expression with the word and.

 Find Numbers with Regular Expressions

We can use special selectors in Regular Expressions to select a particular type of value.

One such selector is the digit selector \d which is used to retrieve one digit (e.g. numbers 0 to 9) in a string.

In JavaScript, it is used like this: /\d/g.

Appending a plus sign (+) after the selector, e.g. /\d+/g, allows this regular expression to match one or more digits.

The trailing g is short for 'global', which allows this regular expression to find all matches rather than stop at the first match.

Instructions
Use the \d selector to select the number of numbers in the string, allowing for the possibility of one or more digit.

We can also use regular expression selectors like \s to find whitespace in a string.

The whitespace characters are " " (space), \r (the carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (the form feed).

The whitespace regular expression looks like this:
